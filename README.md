The current version of the main page is technically incomplete, as it doesn't link to the other pages that will exist and are referenced throughout main page. This is solely because those pages don't exist yet and are going to be made in a later project. Citation of all images used in this project can be found in the "Citations" text document located in the images folder.

The css for index.html is located in style.css, while landing.html's css is in landingStyle.css.

The new page is heavily inspired by the Chuck E Cheese main page, though the writing style is directly inspired by the character Hand Unit's dialog in games such as FNaF: Sister Location, and FNaF: Help Wanted.

There is a navigation bar at the top (made with flexbox) that will link to the other websites once they're implemented. Currently when hovered over, they produce a shadow.

Below that is a poster image of "Freddy and Friend's On Tour".

From there it's a repeating pattern using "div" to separate the segments relating to each of the pages, as well as the introduction.

Each segment is given a unique id, but all share the class "segment". Advanced selectors are used to position the text, while the classes "backgroundImage" and "advenChar" position the background image and "adventure" variants of the accompanying character.

For some of the segments overriding is required to prevent the website's text and the background image's text from clashing.

In one part the text is made purple as a nod to the story of the Five Night's at Freddy's games. I may turn it into a link for a secret page with a spooky image, or leave it as a subtle nod to the lore.
