The current page contains a landing page, a home page, and three of the additional main pages.

The landing has a basic introduction, setting the humorous tone and establishing that the content is written from the perspective of Fazbear Entertainment, who is covering up the controversies and tragedies surrounding their company.

The home page gives a taste of what the other page's format will be, as well as the content inside them. From this point on there is also a navigation bar at the top of the page.

The party packages page shows what type of parties Fazbear entertainment provides, as well as the provided benefits (free refills, cake, etc.). When the "check availability" link is clicked on each segment, it sends the user to a page showing how the party package is booked, prompting the user to head back to the party package page. The centerpiece of the "booked" page is a gif of Helpy over paperwork.

The locations page is much more bare bones, focusing more on dialog, aesthetics, and information rather than interactivity. This page helps expand on the lore of the company being wide spread and why sometimes designs that are over thirty years old are occasionally used in the modern times of the games, the answer being that recreations of these old locations were opened as chains.

The History page is the most intriguing page. It has the most distinct visual style, and contains a quiz in the form of a quiz, the submit button leading to a variant of the page that hides a secret. The normal quiz has four questions, each regarding a historical part of the franchise, and some attempting to cover up the scandals of the past by presenting their own narrative. If the user selects an incorrect option, the text turns red. A correct answer turns green.

On the variant page, the user may notice they can scroll further and should they do so they'll find an image of the vengeful spirit with five radio widgets with no visible text. When checked, the widget will add a white outline to it's text so that it's visible against the black background. This creates an uncomfortably disturbing contrast against the previously cheery quiz, much like the 8-bit mini games from the source material. )
