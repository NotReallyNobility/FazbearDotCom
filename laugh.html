        <h1>FANCY A SCARE???</h1>
        <p>We at Fazbear Entertainment have been the victim of much slander. Freddy's Pizzeria is a safe place for kids and grown ups alike. That doesn't mean we can't have a bit of fun with the rumors though.</p>
        <p>Within this game are recreations of several of those ficticious scenarios, lies, that you may have heard about. This includes working as a night guard in several of our iconic locations, as well as the short lived copyright infringing atraction Fazbear's Fright who is to blame for many of these rumors.</p>
        <p>Other scenarios include an animatronic repairman, a maitenance worker, and a child, each well designed to help you face your fears and see just how silly and unbelievable all those fake scenarios truly are.</p>

        <p>If this is enticing to you, then stop on by to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/732690/FIVE_NIGHTS_AT_FREDDYS_HELP_WANTED/">steam page</a> and get the game!
