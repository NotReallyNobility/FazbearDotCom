            <h2>About Our Faz-erific Company</h2>
            <p>
                We here at Fazbear entertainment are dedicated to bringing fantasy and fun to life! 
                Serving the world smiles and slices since the 1970's, you can gurantee we've gathered every remnant of information on how to provide the best of service.
                Starting small with Fredbear's Family Diner, our business quickly grew with the help of Murray's Costume Manor, and eventual merging with their business.
                Now we've reached towering heights with our      faz-tastic <strong><em>Mega Pizzaplex!</em></strong>
