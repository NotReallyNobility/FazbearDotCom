                <h1>It Started With The Fazbear Frights Horror Attraction</h1>
                <p>Though several of the stories had already been written and published, it wasn't until the Fazbear Frights Horror Attraction that these books started to become more popular.</p>
                <p>These books depicted your favorite characters in dark and twisted ways, and showed Fazbear Entertainment as an entirely negligent and immoral company. While on the surface these books seemed simply made to scare, their use of real people, victims of senseless tragedies unrelated to our brand yet taking place near or within our locations, we considered this slander to be quite problematic. However, these authors and their stories were quite entertaining.</p>

                <h1>We Worked With The Authors to Rework The Stories</h1>
                <p>We at Fazbear Entertainment understood that the original authors were simply working with the material provided to make their stories, their relation to the owner of the Fazbear Frights company was tenuous. After our copyright lawsuit, in which all material relating to our company (including the book series) came under Fazbear ownership. We decided to reach out to the authors and with their help rewrote the stories, helping dilute any real elements from the completely ficticious ones.</p>
                <p>Rather than a man in a rabbit costume being behind the tragic dissapearances in 1985, it was instead a supernatural creature. We also took the liberty of removing or replacing any mention of real persons with fictional characters, so that those whose memory could have been tainted, or painfully resurfaced in the case of many victims to the real versions of these warped tales Fazbear Frights originally produced, wouldn't be brought up. We have now successfully completed all such stories revisions, and the full book line is now available!</p>

                <h1>Lucky For You, Our Publisher Is Scholastic!</h1>
                <p>This means that our books are widely accessible, as Scholastic is one of the largest publishers for children's and young adult books. It's likely you've heard of their many school book fairs, something that we as a children's entertainment franchise are proud to be a significant part of. They can aslo be found in most reputable book stores, such as Barnes and Nobles.</p>
                <p>The original anthology series contains 12 books, with 3 spine chilling stories in each. Currently 5 of those books have graphic novel adaptations. We've also continued the series with the "Fazbear Frights: Tales From the Pizzaplex" bookline, reusing the absurd rumors about our new location to tell new, exciting stories with our books. The series currently has 8 books, also with 3 stories. Only one of these books currently has a graphic novel adaptation, but more are planned.</p>
